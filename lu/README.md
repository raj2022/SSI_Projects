# Machine Learning Across The Frontiers - SSI 2023 Projects

Each HEP frontier presents its own Big Data challenges, inviting the use of AI/ML to tackle them.
Here we choose three specific challenges, one from each of the Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic Frontiers, that can be tackled during the school by small project teams.

Each has a dataset associated with it, which can be either downloaded to your local (or remote) computing resource, or imported to Google colab.
Your team might then pick up one of the approaches described in the lectures, and try and apply it.
We provide a number of tutorial notebooks below, that introduce the datasets and provide some possible starting points for you.

On the last Thursday of the school, we will hear very short presentations from each project team in a common slide deck, and award various small prizes.

For maximum community value, project teams should plan to submit their project notebook back to this repo via a pull request, so everyone can benefit from their hard work. Fork this repo and get to work!

Have a look at the [`Getting Started`](https://github.com/makagan/SSI_Projects/blob/main/slides/GettingStarted.pdf) slides to get started with Github and Google Colab.

## The Challenges

**Energy Frontier:** here, the challenge is to develop ML models for LHC jets.
These could be for classification, or generative modeling.
We provide a dataset to explore that includes various boosted jets, including high-level jet features, jet-images, and per-particle features.
Many thanks to SSI lecturer Jennifer Ngadubia, from whose recent [`course`](https://github.com/jngadiub/ML_course_Pavia_23/blob/main/) the materials for this challenge are drawn!

**Cosmic Frontier:** here, the challenge is to develop methods for mapping Dark Matter in the Universe from weak lensing data, after exploring some related inverse problems using LSST-like imaging data. We provide suitable weak lensing datasets.
Many thanks to SSI Lecturer Fran√ßois Lanusse for the materials for this challenge, which are based on the materials used at the [Quarks2Cosmos conference](https://github.com/EiffL/Quarks2CosmosDataChallenge/tree/colab)!

**Intensity Frontier:** here, the challenge is to...
Many thanks to SSI Organizer Kazu Terao for the materials for this challenge!
